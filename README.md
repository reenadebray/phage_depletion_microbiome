Abstract:
Many infectious diseases are associated with altered bacteriophage communities. As parasites of bacteria, phages can regulate microbiome diversity and composition and may therefore affect disease susceptibility. Observational studies alone do not allow us to determine whether altered phage profiles are a contributor to disease risk, a response to infection, or simply an indicator of dysbiosis. To address this question, we used size-selective filtration to deplete plant-associated microbial communities of phages, then challenged plants with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Plants with phage-depleted microbiomes were more susceptible to infection, an effect that could not be explained by direct effects of phages on either P. syringae or the plant host. Moreover, the presence of phages was most impactful when they were isolated from neighboring field locations rather than from the same host plant, possibly suggesting that moderate rates of lysis maintain a community structure that is most resistant to pathogen invasion. Overall, our results support the idea that phage communities contribute to plant defenses by modulating the microbiome.
